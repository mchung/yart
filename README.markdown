==========================

A Rails template by Marc Chung. To create a Rails project with this template:

Yart encapsulates the body of Rails knowledge acquired from several hundred years of Rails development.

What does Yart do?
==================

1. Installs the latest Rails gems into vendor/gems
2. Requires the use of database sessions
3. Uses the OpenRain Power Tools for convenient deployment
4. Comes with the following RUNTIME gems
  * clearance - for User authentication

5. Comes with the following TESTING gems
  * factory_girl - an alternative to fixtures
  * rspec - an alternative to Test Unit
